## Importance of Star Ratings

Star ratings and reviews are essential in helping patients make informed decisions about their care, specifically when choosing a provider or medical practice. Consumers heavily rely on third party review sites to make decisions about businesses or services they are seeking; however, these sites typically fall short when it comes to provider information. For this reason, it’s important for health systems to publish patient reviews directly on their website so they are the source of truth of their patients’ healthcare experiences.  Publishing star ratings and reviews also gives existing and new patients a better view into a health system. 

Other benefits of publishing star ratings and reviews include:
- SEO improvements with the addition of schema markup
- Increase in CTR and time on page
