## Importance of Data

Data is the foundation of any health system. Our platform serves as a source-of-truth for provider and location, consumer facing data and aims at organizing, structuring, and enriching it. Not only does it drive Loyal’s consumer facing applications, the goal is to fuel all applications that rely on this data, whether it’s appointment scheduling, physician search , or a health system’s website. 

Data Management cleanses and centralizes provider and location data from a variety of data sources to create an accurate and complete representation.  For provider data this includes key attributes, specialties, and any associated clinical taxonomy terms. This optimizes provider search results in order to surface physicians that better align with consumer expectations. Having centralized data ensures any future update is automatically dispersed across any number of third-party applications to guarantee a health system’s information is accurate everywhere, anytime.

With our tools, health systems have a real-time view of their data health. They have insight into the overall completeness of their data, as well as individual data fields for provider, location, and other data types. This allows health systems to focus on areas in need of improvement and manage their resources more efficiently.
