### Supporting TLS 1.2

<p class="warning">
  IMPORTANT: After July 31, 2018, the Loyal API and Guide web application will require TLS 1.2. Older versions of TLS will no longer be supported. Virtually all modern web browsers and operating systems have implemented support for TLS 1.2. However, we recommend you test your Loyal integrations to ensure a seamless transition.
</p>

### Testing for TLS Support

You can test user agents for TLS 1.2 protocol support using the [SSL test tool from SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html), or check their [user agent capabilities list](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/clients.html).
